    <span class="bod"><span>I love Fruit Smoothies. I love 
    their flavor, how easy they are to make, and their versatility. There is no denying 
    their popularity. A Fruit Smoothie is a very nutritious blended drink with a 
    milkshake-like consistency that starts with either fresh or frozen fruit. To 
    the fruit you can add a variety of ingredients. Popular choices are frozen 
    ices (sorbet or sherbet), yogurt (plain or flavored), crushed ice, and/or 
    fruit juices. </span></span>

    <span><span class="bod">  <span>

      Smoothies are best enjoyed shortly after making them as they do begin to 
    separate over time. </span></span></span></p>

     --></p>      The Fruit Smoothie recipes given here are different from most in that they

      include frozen ices.

      You can use either a sorbet or a sherbet as both are made using fresh fruit (juices/purees),

      sugar, water and sometimes lemon/lime juice. Sherbets, though, also contain

      milk and/or cream, and sometimes even eggs which will give your Smoothie a

      rich and smooth consistency.<p>A good Smoothie uses high

      quality ingredients, that means fresh fruit at its prime.  <span>

      Some excellent choices are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, 
      blackberries, cherries, peaches,

      nectarines, kiwi, cantaloupe, honeydew, papaya, pineapple, bananas, mango,

      and orange segments. You can also use frozen fruit which has the advantage 
      of chilling your Smoothie </span>so you do not have to add crushed ice and 
      giving it a thick consistency. You may, however, have to add a little 
      extra fruit juice if you find your Smoothie is too thick. Also, try to use 
      unsweetened fruit and it does not need to be thawed. Another point on 
      fruit choices. Keep in mind that some fruits, like bananas, add both 
      sweetness and flavor to your Smoothie, and they also have the advantage of 
      being a natural thickener. If you are going to add ice, try to use crushed 
      or shaved ice as it easier to blend than ice cubes. If you do not have 
      crushed ice, then place ice cubes in a plastic freezer bag, wrap it in a 
      dish towel, and pound it with a rolling pin or meat mallet until it is 
      crushed.</p>

      <p>Smoothie recipes should serve as a template only. Both the type and

      amount of fruit, frozen ices,

      yogurt, and fruit juice can be adjusted to suit your taste. Although

      sweetness usually comes from the fruit and yogurt, add a little granulated

      white sugar, maple syrup, honey, brown rice syrup or even a banana if you 
      like a sweeter drink.Â </p></span></span></span>
